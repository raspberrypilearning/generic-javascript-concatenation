**Concatenation** is a fancy word which just means "joining strings together". A string
consists of one or more letters, numbers or symbols and is enclosed by quotes.

This is a literal string - `"My favourite animal is a "`
This is a variable which contains a string - `var animal = "cat";`

You can join strings together using a `+` like this:

```JavaScript
var new_string = "My favourite animal is a " + animal;
```

This code creates a variable called `new_string` and sets its value to `"My favourite animal is a cat"`.

You can join more than one string together at a time - just use a `+` everywhere you need to join strings.

```JavaScript
var name = "Laura";
var animal = "cat";
var new_string = "My name is " + name + " and my favourite animal is a " + animal;
```
